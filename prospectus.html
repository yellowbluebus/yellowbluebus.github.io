            <p>HABITABLE STUDIO is a think-tank established to build habitable domestic, urban and rural environments. We argue that our social and environmental responsibility demands the creation of healthy livable spaces:
                <ul>
                    <li>precise in their dimensions</li>
                    <li>flexible to allow a multiplicity of uses</li>
                    <li>with interactive boundaries</li>
                    <li>that rethink materials</li>
                    <li>adaptable to changing human needs and desires</li>
                    <li>in harmony with the body</li>
                    <li>that favor creativity and play</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p">Habitable Studio specializes in housing and educational buildings, with a humanistic and ecological vision.
