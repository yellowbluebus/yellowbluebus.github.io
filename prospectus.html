                <ul>
                    <li>that allow a multiplicity of uses</li>
                    <li>adaptable to changing human needs and desires</li>
                    <li>that rethink materials</li>
                    <li>with interactive boundaries</li>
                    <li>in harmony with the body</li>
                    <li>that favor creativity and play</li>
                </ul>
